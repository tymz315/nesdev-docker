This file describe map output format of Unofficial-MagicKit (it will
create such a file (with .map extension) if the -M switch is specified).

All numbers are in small-endian format.

The header is 16-bytes long.

=== Offset === Size === Description ======================================
         0     WORD     Max zeropage address used
         2     WORD     Max BSS address used
         4     BYTE     Machine type (0=PC-Engine, 1=Famicom/NES)
         5     BYTE     Max bank number (number of banks minus 1)
         6     ten      Reserved (currently all set to zero)

After the header is the first 8K of the "EMU" section.

Next is the map data of each 8K bank, each 8K in size. The byte consists
of the page number in the low three bits, and the section number in the
high three bits; the other bits can be used for a user-defined use. The
page number is 0 to 7 (corresponding to the 8K blocks of a 64K address
space) and the section number can be 2 for code sections or 3 for data
sections or 7 for unused sections.

After that is the bank names, which is 16 bytes each. Consecutive banks
with the same name are considered as joined together.

Finally is the symbols list. They are in the internal "hash table" order;
don't expect it to be in any particular order, since the hash table order
can change.

Each symbol is:

=== Offset === Size === Description ======================================
       $00     BYTE     Reserved (1 if symbol is reserved, 0 otherwise)
       $01     BYTE     Symbol type
       $02     WORD     Value
       $04     BYTE     Bank
       $05     BYTE     Page number
       $06     WORD     Size
       $08     BYTE     Data type
       $09     WORD     Data size
       $0A     BYTE     Length of name
       $0B     ???      Name

The reserved flag means that this is created by the assembler itself or by
by the ASSIGN command; such a thing isn't part of the program, so you may
wish to ignore it when reading this file. However, for a counted label,
the reserved flag is always set to 1.

Symbol types are:
  1 = Undefined (may be a zero page)
  2 = Undefined but checked in a IF expression
  3 = Multiply defined (this is an error and should never occur)
  4 = An ordinary symbol
  5 = Macro
  6 = Function
  7 = Counted label

In most cases you probably can ignore any symbol other than type 4.
